## About Me

I am a recent graduate from the University of Northern Colorado with a Bachelor's in Computer Science - Software Engineering with a minor in Asian Studies. This undergraduate degree covered several object-oriented software development languages such as Python, Java, and C#, and even covered web development with HTML5, CSS, and JS. I have been interested in computers since I was young and have built several from scratch. This has turned into a passion for working with computers physically and digitally to solve problems and automate processes. I am currently tackling coding challenges in langauges like C# and Python to prepare myself for working as a Software Engineer or I.T. Technician.

## Unity "Makeup Shader"

The above images show off a simple unity shader I made. Unity does not inherit multiple textures for a single material by default and the model only has one "zone" to apply a material, so I needed to create a way so that it would inherit both the skin texture and the makeup around the eyes in one material. It was coded in C#, the standard language for Unity projects.
